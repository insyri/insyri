# hey, im insyri
I started programming two years ago, self taught and brought myself here.
My main language is JavaScript, but I'm moving to TypeScript as of time of writing this.
I'm also learning C/C++ and Rust, probably Python or Assembly next.

I program Discord bots and mess around on Spencer's Pylon mainly. Front-end I guess but I don't really do that on free time.

I dont really showcase my projects since, well, I never finish them but also I use github in replacement of google docs along with any useless crap I want/need to paste.
