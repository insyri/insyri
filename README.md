# hey, im insyri
I started programming two years ago, self taught and brought myself here.
My main language is JavaScript, but I'm moving to TypeScript as of time of writing this.
I'm also learning C while I'm at that, sooo yeah

I make Discord Bots, Javascript including webpages, and fool around on machines with C.
I'm a straight male and I dislike people who use their political oppression to oppress others with things that do not solve anything.

anyways yeah lol this is my profile, i dont commit too much code but when i do it'll be more than a little.
